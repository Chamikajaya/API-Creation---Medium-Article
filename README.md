# 🚀 Constructing Scalable Backends for Modern Web Apps   using Node, Express and MongoDB



<p align="center">
  This is the repository for the Medium article series written by me titled "Constructing Scalable Backends for Modern Web Apps using Node, Express, and MongoDB." The series takes you through the journey of building a scalable backend infrastructure for an online course platform.
</p>

## 📚 About the Series

The article series is structured into three comprehensive parts:

1. **Part 1**: We start by setting up our environment, crafting a course model with Mongoose, and seeding our database with initial data.
2. **Part 2**: We will tackle creating the route handlers to allow clients to interact with our API.
3. **Part 3**: The series will conclude with the addition of user models and the implementation of authentication and authorization to secure our API and manage user access.

> **⚠️ Note: Articles 2 and 3 are coming soon! Stay tuned for more updates.**
